# Logytics - Log Analysis Project

In this project, we pursued the use case to build an unsupervised model to identify and correlate warnings and error messages.

To accomplish this we used Python, Spark, and Flask.

## Data Processing

Data processing was performed using Python and Spark in Scala.

1. First the data was brought into Python, split, stripped of all special characters, and the numbers were replaced.
2. Results from Python were fed into Spark for their word counts and uniqe log messages.

### To run the code:

1. The Python file will run as is.
2. The Spark in Scala will need the winutils file and a JDK to run.
